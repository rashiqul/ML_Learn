# ML Learning Course Notebooks & Scripts

Welcome to the ML_Learn repository! This project contains Python notebooks and scripts that follow the curriculum of the popular [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Bonus](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci/) course on Udemy. The repository is organized to help you learn and practice a wide range of machine learning techniques, from data preprocessing to advanced deep learning and model selection.

## Repository Structure

- **Part 1 - Data Preprocessing**: Tools and templates for cleaning and preparing data.
- **Part 2 - Regression**: Simple, multiple, polynomial, SVR, decision tree, and random forest regression.
- **Part 3 - Classification**: Logistic regression, K-NN, SVM, kernel SVM, naive Bayes, decision tree, and random forest classification.
- **Part 4 - Clustering**: K-means and hierarchical clustering.
- **Part 5 - Association Rule Learning**: Apriori and Eclat algorithms.
- **Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning**: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling.
- **Part 7 - Natural Language Processing**: Text cleaning, bag of words, and classification.
- **Part 8 - Deep Learning**: Artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN).
- **Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Kernel PCA.
- **Part 10 - Model Selection and Boosting**: Model selection, k-fold cross-validation, grid search, and XGBoost.

Each section contains Python notebooks that demonstrate the concepts with code, explanations, and visualizations. Some sections also include R scripts for comparison.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rashiqul/ML_Learn.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired section** and open the Python notebooks (`.ipynb`) in your favorite environment (VS Code, Jupyter, Colab, etc.).
3. **Install required libraries** as needed (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, `xgboost`).
